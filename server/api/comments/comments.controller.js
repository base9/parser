  [ 'Every eye was fastened with severe inquiry upon Sir Kay.','But he was equal to the occasion.',' He got up and played his hand like a major—and took every trick.',' He said he would state the case exactly according to the facts; he would tell the simple straightforward tale, without comment of his own; "and then," said he, "if ye find glory and honor due, ye will give it unto him who is the mightiest man of his hands that ever bare shield or strake with sword in the ranks of Christian battle—even him that sitteth there!" and he pointed to Sir Launcelot.',' Ah, he fetched them; it was a rattling good stroke.',' Then he went on and told how Sir Launcelot, seeking adventures, some brief time gone by, killed seven giants at one sweep of his sword, and set a hundred and forty-two captive maidens free; and then went further, still seeking adventures, and found him (Sir Kay) fighting a desperate fight against nine foreign knights, and straightway took the battle solely into his own hands, and conquered the nine; and that night Sir Launcelot rose quietly, and dressed him in Sir Kays armor and took Sir Kays horse and gat him away into distant lands, and vanquished sixteen knights in one pitched battle and thirty-four in another; and all these and the former nine he made to swear that about Whitsuntide they would ride to Arthurs court and yield them to Queen Guenevers hands as captives of Sir Kay the Seneschal, spoil of his knightly prowess; and now here were these half dozen, and the rest would be along as soon as they might be healed of their desperate wounds.','.' ],
  [ 'We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned.',' All the boys did.',' We hadnt robbed nobody, hadnt killed any people, but only just pretended.',' We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them.',' Tom Sawyer called the hogs `ingots,` and he called the turnips and stuff `julery,` and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and marked.',' But I couldnt see no profit in it.',' One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand `sumter` mules, all loaded down with dimonds, and they didnt have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things.',' He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready.',' He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warnt worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before.',' I didnt believe we could lick such a crowd, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill.',' and there warnt no camels nor no elephants.',' It warnt anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at that.',' We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.','.' ],
  [ 'But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to mind his own eye.','The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck.','The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness.','It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters.','Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale.','In the midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe.','The schooner was run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.','For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam.','I looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.','The greenhorn had gone down.','Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now took an instants glance around him, and seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.','A few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form.','The boat soon picked them up.','The poor bumpkin was restored.','All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the captain begged his pardon.','From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.']
