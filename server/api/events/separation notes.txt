breaking data-parser into a separate server:

event model and schema and etc will remain in main repo


scraper connections, cron jobs, date/time parsing, etc will go to parsing repo

both repos will have a connection to the geocoding server (just in case)

when new events are posted to the main server, it will pass them along to
the parsing server as quickly as possible.
